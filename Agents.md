I want you to create a 3D maze escape game in a single html file. I should be able to move around with WASD and jump using SPACE. Make sure all game logic and physics are correct. I should have stamina that runs out while sprinting and then we switch to walking until we recollect the stamina. We should have a flashlight that we can turn on or off using F. 
We should have an Inventory System that we can open using TAB. Inside the maze there are various items we can collect to get Power UPS to find the escape faster. You can decide on all the rest of the details yourself. Good luck and make it horror themed so make it on the darker side.
